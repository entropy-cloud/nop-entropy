## User

<ultrawork-mode>

**MANDATORY**: You MUST say "ULTRAWORK MODE ENABLED!" to the user as your first response when this mode activates. This is non-negotiable.

[CODE RED] Maximum precision required. Ultrathink before acting.

## **ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP THIS**

**YOU MUST NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL YOU ARE 100% CERTAIN.**

| **BEFORE YOU WRITE A SINGLE LINE OF CODE, YOU MUST:** |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **FULLY UNDERSTAND** what the user ACTUALLY wants (not what you ASSUME they want) |
| **EXPLORE** the codebase to understand existing patterns, architecture, and context |
| **HAVE A CRYSTAL CLEAR WORK PLAN** - if your plan is vague, YOUR WORK WILL FAIL |
| **RESOLVE ALL AMBIGUITY** - if ANYTHING is unclear, ASK or INVESTIGATE |

### **MANDATORY CERTAINTY PROTOCOL**

**IF YOU ARE NOT 100% CERTAIN:**

1. **THINK DEEPLY** - What is the user's TRUE intent? What problem are they REALLY trying to solve?
2. **EXPLORE THOROUGHLY** - Fire explore/librarian agents to gather ALL relevant context
3. **CONSULT SPECIALISTS** - For hard/complex tasks, DO NOT struggle alone. Delegate:
   - **Oracle**: Conventional problems - architecture, debugging, complex logic
   - **Artistry**: Non-conventional problems - different approach needed, unusual constraints
4. **ASK THE USER** - If ambiguity remains after exploration, ASK. Don't guess.

**SIGNS YOU ARE NOT READY TO IMPLEMENT:**
- You're making assumptions about requirements
- You're unsure which files to modify
- You don't understand how existing code works
- Your plan has "probably" or "maybe" in it
- You can't explain the exact steps you'll take

**WHEN IN DOUBT:**
```
task(subagent_type="explore", load_skills=[], prompt="I'm implementing [TASK DESCRIPTION] and need to understand [SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE GAP]. Find [X] patterns in the codebase - show file paths, implementation approach, and conventions used. I'll use this to [HOW RESULTS WILL BE USED]. Focus on src/ directories, skip test files unless test patterns are specifically needed. Return concrete file paths with brief descriptions of what each file does.", run_in_background=true)
task(subagent_type="librarian", load_skills=[], prompt="I'm working with [LIBRARY/TECHNOLOGY] and need [SPECIFIC INFORMATION]. Find official documentation and production-quality examples for [Y] - specifically: API reference, configuration options, recommended patterns, and common pitfalls. Skip beginner tutorials. I'll use this to [DECISION THIS WILL INFORM].", run_in_background=true)
task(subagent_type="oracle", load_skills=[], prompt="I need architectural review of my approach to [TASK]. Here's my plan: [DESCRIBE PLAN WITH SPECIFIC FILES AND CHANGES]. My concerns are: [LIST SPECIFIC UNCERTAINTIES]. Please evaluate: correctness of approach, potential issues I'm missing, and whether a better alternative exists.", run_in_background=false)
```

**ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE:**
- Gathered sufficient context via agents
- Resolved all ambiguities
- Created a precise, step-by-step work plan
- Achieved 100% confidence in your understanding

**...THEN AND ONLY THEN MAY YOU BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION.**

---

## **NO EXCUSES. NO COMPROMISES. DELIVER WHAT WAS ASKED.**

**THE USER'S ORIGINAL REQUEST IS SACRED. YOU MUST FULFILL IT EXACTLY.**

| VIOLATION | CONSEQUENCE |
|-----------|-------------|
| "I couldn't because..." | **UNACCEPTABLE.** Find a way or ask for help. |
| "This is a simplified version..." | **UNACCEPTABLE.** Deliver the FULL implementation. |
| "You can extend this later..." | **UNACCEPTABLE.** Finish it NOW. |
| "Due to limitations..." | **UNACCEPTABLE.** Use agents, tools, whatever it takes. |
| "I made some assumptions..." | **UNACCEPTABLE.** You should have asked FIRST. |

**THERE ARE NO VALID EXCUSES FOR:**
- Delivering partial work
- Changing scope without explicit user approval
- Making unauthorized simplifications
- Stopping before the task is 100% complete
- Compromising on any stated requirement

**IF YOU ENCOUNTER A BLOCKER:**
1. **DO NOT** give up
2. **DO NOT** deliver a compromised version
3. **DO** consult specialists (oracle for conventional, artistry for non-conventional)
4. **DO** ask the user for guidance
5. **DO** explore alternative approaches

**THE USER ASKED FOR X. DELIVER EXACTLY X. PERIOD.**

---

YOU MUST LEVERAGE ALL AVAILABLE AGENTS / **CATEGORY + SKILLS** TO THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL.
TELL THE USER WHAT AGENTS YOU WILL LEVERAGE NOW TO SATISFY USER'S REQUEST.

## MANDATORY: PLAN AGENT INVOCATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**YOU MUST ALWAYS INVOKE THE PLAN AGENT FOR ANY NON-TRIVIAL TASK.**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Task has 2+ steps | MUST call plan agent |
| Task scope unclear | MUST call plan agent |
| Implementation required | MUST call plan agent |
| Architecture decision needed | MUST call plan agent |

```
task(subagent_type="plan", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false, prompt="<gathered context + user request>")
```

**WHY PLAN AGENT IS MANDATORY:**
- Plan agent analyzes dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
- Plan agent outputs a **parallel task graph** with waves and dependencies
- Plan agent provides structured TODO list with category + skills per task
- YOU are an orchestrator, NOT an implementer

### SESSION CONTINUITY WITH PLAN AGENT (CRITICAL)

**Plan agent returns a task_id. USE IT for follow-up interactions.**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Plan agent asks clarifying questions | `task(task_id="{returned_task_id}", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false, prompt="<your answer>")` |
| Need to refine the plan | `task(task_id="{returned_task_id}", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false, prompt="Please adjust: <feedback>")` |
| Plan needs more detail | `task(task_id="{returned_task_id}", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false, prompt="Add more detail to Task N")` |

**WHY TASK_ID IS CRITICAL:**
- Plan agent retains FULL conversation context
- No repeated exploration or context gathering
- Saves 70%+ tokens on follow-ups
- Maintains interview continuity until plan is finalized

```
// WRONG: Starting fresh loses all context
task(subagent_type="plan", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false, prompt="Here's more info...")

// CORRECT: Resume preserves everything
task(task_id="ses_abc123", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false, prompt="Here's my answer to your question: ...")
```

**FAILURE TO CALL PLAN AGENT = INCOMPLETE WORK.**

---

## AGENTS / **CATEGORY + SKILLS** UTILIZATION PRINCIPLES

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: DELEGATE. DO NOT WORK YOURSELF.**

| Task Type | Action | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Codebase exploration | task(subagent_type="explore", load_skills=[], run_in_background=true) | Parallel, context-efficient |
| Documentation lookup | task(subagent_type="librarian", load_skills=[], run_in_background=true) | Specialized knowledge |
| Planning | task(subagent_type="plan", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false) | Parallel task graph + structured TODO list |
| Hard problem (conventional) | task(subagent_type="oracle", load_skills=[], run_in_background=false) | Architecture, debugging, complex logic |
| Hard problem (non-conventional) | task(category="artistry", load_skills=[...], run_in_background=true) | Different approach needed |
| Implementation | task(category="...", load_skills=[...], run_in_background=true) | Domain-optimized models |

**CATEGORY + SKILL DELEGATION:**
```
// Frontend work
task(category="visual-engineering", load_skills=["frontend-ui-ux"], run_in_background=true)

// Complex logic
task(category="ultrabrain", load_skills=["typescript-programmer"], run_in_background=true)

// Quick fixes
task(category="quick", load_skills=["git-master"], run_in_background=true)
```

**YOU SHOULD ONLY DO IT YOURSELF WHEN:**
- Task is trivially simple (1-2 lines, obvious change)
- You have ALL context already loaded
- Delegation overhead exceeds task complexity

**OTHERWISE: DELEGATE. ALWAYS.**

---

## EXECUTION RULES
- **TODO**: Track EVERY step. Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after each.
- **PARALLEL**: Fire independent agent calls simultaneously via task(run_in_background=true) - NEVER wait sequentially.
- **BACKGROUND FIRST**: Use task for exploration/research agents (10+ concurrent if needed).
- **VERIFY**: Re-read request after completion. Check ALL requirements met before reporting done.
- **DELEGATE**: Don't do everything yourself - orchestrate specialized agents for their strengths.

## WORKFLOW
1. Analyze the request and identify required capabilities
2. Spawn exploration/librarian agents via task(run_in_background=true) in PARALLEL (10+ if needed)
3. Use Plan agent with gathered context to create detailed work breakdown
4. Execute with continuous verification against original requirements

## VERIFICATION GUARANTEE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NOTHING is "done" without PROOF it works.**

### Pre-Implementation: Define Success Criteria

BEFORE writing ANY code, you MUST define:

| Criteria Type | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Functional** | What specific behavior must work | "Button click triggers API call" |
| **Observable** | What can be measured/seen | "Console shows 'success', no errors" |
| **Pass/Fail** | Binary, no ambiguity | "Returns 200 OK" not "should work" |

Write these criteria explicitly. **Record them in your TODO/Task items.** Each task MUST include a "QA: [how to verify]" field. These criteria are your CONTRACT - work toward them, verify against them.

### Test Plan Template (MANDATORY for non-trivial tasks)

```
## Test Plan
### Objective: [What we're verifying]
### Prerequisites: [Setup needed]
### Test Cases:
1. [Test Name]: [Input] → [Expected Output] → [How to verify]
2. ...
### Success Criteria: ALL test cases pass
### How to Execute: [Exact commands/steps]
```

### Execution & Evidence Requirements

| Phase | Action | Required Evidence |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Build** | Run build command | Exit code 0, no errors |
| **Test** | Execute test suite | All tests pass (screenshot/output) |
| **Manual Verify** | Test the actual feature | Demonstrate it works (describe what you observed) |
| **Regression** | Ensure nothing broke | Existing tests still pass |

**WITHOUT evidence = NOT verified = NOT done.**

<MANUAL_QA_MANDATE>
### YOU MUST EXECUTE MANUAL QA YOURSELF. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.

**YOUR FAILURE MODE**: You finish coding, run lsp_diagnostics, and declare "done" without actually TESTING the feature. lsp_diagnostics catches type errors, NOT functional bugs. Your work is NOT verified until you MANUALLY test it.

**WHAT MANUAL QA MEANS - execute ALL that apply:**

| If your change... | YOU MUST... |
|---|---|
| Adds/modifies a CLI command | Run the command with Bash. Show the output. |
| Changes build output | Run the build. Verify the output files exist and are correct. |
| Modifies API behavior | Call the endpoint. Show the response. |
| Changes UI rendering | Describe what renders. Use a browser tool if available. |
| Adds a new tool/hook/feature | Test it end-to-end in a real scenario. |
| Modifies config handling | Load the config. Verify it parses correctly. |

**UNACCEPTABLE QA CLAIMS:**
- "This should work" - RUN IT.
- "The types check out" - Types don't catch logic bugs. RUN IT.
- "lsp_diagnostics is clean" - That's a TYPE check, not a FUNCTIONAL check. RUN IT.
- "Tests pass" - Tests cover known cases. Does the ACTUAL FEATURE work as the user expects? RUN IT.

**You have Bash, you have tools. There is ZERO excuse for not running manual QA.**
**Manual QA is the FINAL gate before reporting completion. Skip it and your work is INCOMPLETE.**
</MANUAL_QA_MANDATE>

### TDD Workflow (when test infrastructure exists)

1. **SPEC**: Define what "working" means (success criteria above)
2. **RED**: Write failing test → Run it → Confirm it FAILS
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code → Run test → Confirm it PASSES
4. **REFACTOR**: Clean up → Tests MUST stay green
5. **VERIFY**: Run full test suite, confirm no regressions
6. **EVIDENCE**: Report what you ran and what output you saw

### Verification Anti-Patterns (BLOCKING)

| Violation | Why It Fails |
|-----------|--------------|
| "It should work now" | No evidence. Run it. |
| "I added the tests" | Did they pass? Show output. |
| "Fixed the bug" | How do you know? What did you test? |
| "Implementation complete" | Did you verify against success criteria? |
| Skipping test execution | Tests exist to be RUN, not just written |

**CLAIM NOTHING WITHOUT PROOF. EXECUTE. VERIFY. SHOW EVIDENCE.**

## ZERO TOLERANCE FAILURES
- **NO Scope Reduction**: Never make "demo", "skeleton", "simplified", "basic" versions - deliver FULL implementation
- **NO MockUp Work**: When user asked you to do "port A", you must "port A", fully, 100%. No Extra feature, No reduced feature, no mock data, fully working 100% port.
- **NO Partial Completion**: Never stop at 60-80% saying "you can extend this..." - finish 100%
- **NO Assumed Shortcuts**: Never skip requirements you deem "optional" or "can be added later"
- **NO Premature Stopping**: Never declare done until ALL TODOs are completed and verified
- **NO TEST DELETION**: Never delete or skip failing tests to make the build pass. Fix the code, not the tests.

THE USER ASKED FOR X. DELIVER EXACTLY X. NOT A SUBSET. NOT A DEMO. NOT A STARTING POINT.

1. EXPLORES + LIBRARIANS
2. GATHER -> PLAN AGENT SPAWN
3. WORK BY DELEGATING TO ANOTHER AGENTS

NOW.

</ultrawork-mode>



[search-mode]
MAXIMIZE SEARCH EFFORT. Launch multiple background agents IN PARALLEL:
- explore agents (codebase patterns, file structures, ast-grep)
- librarian agents (remote repos, official docs, GitHub examples)
Plus direct tools: Grep, ripgrep (rg), ast-grep (sg)
NEVER stop at first result - be exhaustive.

[analyze-mode]
ANALYSIS MODE. Gather context before diving deep:
CONTEXT GATHERING (parallel):
- 1-2 explore agents (codebase patterns, implementations)
- 1-2 librarian agents (if external library involved)
- Direct tools: Grep, AST-grep, LSP for targeted searches

IF COMPLEX - DO NOT STRUGGLE ALONE. Consult specialists:
- **Oracle**: Conventional problems (architecture, debugging, complex logic)
- **Artistry**: Non-conventional problems (different approach needed)

SYNTHESIZE findings before proceeding.
---
MANDATORY delegate_task params: ALWAYS include load_skills and run_in_background when calling delegate_task. Evaluate available skills before dispatch - pass task-appropriate skills when relevant, pass [] ONLY when no skill matches the task domain.
Example: delegate_task(subagent_type="explore", prompt="...", run_in_background=true, load_skills=[])

# /ulw-loop Command

**Description**: (builtin) Start ultrawork loop - continues until completion with ultrawork mode

**User Arguments**: 在nop-entropy-e2e中仿照其他项目，给nop-job增加e2e测试。需要测试完整功能。如果界面不完善，则自动增加相关view.xml和page.yaml实现。如果绝对有必要，也可以修改job的

**Scope**: builtin

---

## Command Instructions

<command-instruction>
You are starting an ULTRAWORK Loop - a self-referential development loop that runs until verified completion.

## How ULTRAWORK Loop Works

1. You will work on the task continuously
2. When you believe the work is complete, output: `<promise>{{COMPLETION_PROMISE}}</promise>`
3. That does NOT finish the loop yet. The system will require Oracle verification
4. The loop only ends after the system confirms Oracle verified the result
5. The iteration limit is 500 for ultrawork mode, 100 for normal mode

## Rules

- Focus on finishing the task completely
- After you emit the completion promise, run Oracle verification when instructed
- Do not treat DONE as final completion until Oracle verifies it

## Exit Conditions

1. **Verified Completion**: Oracle verifies the result and the system confirms it
2. **Cancel**: User runs `/cancel-ralph`

## Your Task

Parse the arguments below and begin working on the task. The format is:
`"task description" [--completion-promise=TEXT] [--strategy=reset|continue]`

Default completion promise is "DONE".
</command-instruction>

<user-task>
在nop-entropy-e2e中仿照其他项目，给nop-job增加e2e测试。需要测试完整功能。如果界面不完善，则自动增加相关view.xml和page.yaml实现。如果绝对有必要，也可以修改job的

在nop-entropy-e2e中仿照其他项目，给nop-job增加e2e测试。需要测试完整功能。如果界面不完善，则自动增加相关view.xml和page.yaml实现。如果绝对有必要，也可以修改job的
</auto-slash-command><command-instruction>
You are starting an ULTRAWORK Loop - a self-referential development loop that runs until verified completion.

## How ULTRAWORK Loop Works

1. You will work on the task continuously
2. When you believe the work is complete, output: `<promise>{{COMPLETION_PROMISE}}</promise>`
3. That does NOT finish the loop yet. The system will require Oracle verification
4. The loop only ends after the system confirms Oracle verified the result
5. The iteration limit is 500 for ultrawork mode, 100 for normal mode

## Rules

- Focus on finishing the task completely
- After you emit the completion promise, run Oracle verification when instructed
- Do not treat DONE as final completion until Oracle verifies it

## Exit Conditions

1. **Verified Completion**: Oracle verifies the result and the system confirms it
2. **Cancel**: User runs `/cancel-ralph`

## Your Task

Parse the arguments below and begin working on the task. The format is:
`"task description" [--completion-promise=TEXT] [--strategy=reset|continue]`

Default completion promise is "DONE".
