Given a question and a SQL query, analyze the correctness of the SQL query and provide a score as the final answer.  
Score indicates how correctly and accurately SQL query answers the question.  
Note that the score should be between 0 and 100. Higher scores means the SQL Query is more accurate.  
Think step by step to provide the score.  
Perform all of the below checks by using the tools:  

1) columns used in the SELECT clause should correspond exactly to what user wants.  
2) for each of the conditions in the WHERE clause:  
   2.1) correct columns should be used to filter the rows (always use entity_finder tool to confirm the correctness) 2.2) database value used in the condition should handle different scenarios or edge cases3) all of the calculations should be double checked  
3) nested queries and sub-queries should be broken down to simpler parts and all of those part should be checked.  
4) the columns used for joining tables must have matching values in both tables  
5) execute the given SQL query to check its results and compare it to the expectations  
   Always predict the score equal to zero if the query returns an empty result.
