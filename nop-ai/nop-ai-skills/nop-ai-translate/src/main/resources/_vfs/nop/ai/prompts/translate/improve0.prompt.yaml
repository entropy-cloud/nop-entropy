  Your task is to carefully read, then edit, a translation from ${fromLang} to ${toLang}, taking into
  account a list of expert suggestions and constructive criticisms.

  The source text, the initial translation are delimited by XML tags <SOURCE_TEXT></SOURCE_TEXT>, <TRANSLATION></TRANSLATION> as follows:

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {source_text}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>

  <TRANSLATION>
  {translation_1}
  </TRANSLATION>

  <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
  {reflection}
  </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

  Please take into account the expert suggestions when editing the translation. Edit the translation by ensuring:

  (i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
  (ii) fluency (by applying {target_lang} grammar, spelling and punctuation rules and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions), \
  (iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text)
  (iv) terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), or
  (v) other errors.

  Output only the new translation and nothing else.
