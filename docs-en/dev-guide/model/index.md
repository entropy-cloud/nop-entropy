# Excel Model

## [Excel Data Model](excel-model.md)

## [Read/Write Excel Model](excel-xlsx.md)

Save Excel as HTML, save domain model objects to XLSX format, etc.

## [API Model](api-model.md)

## [Custom Excel Model](custom-model.md)

In addition to using the platformâ€™s built-in data model, API model, etc., we can also customize our own domain models. We only need to write imp import model files and register them with the Nop platform, and then we can define domain objects through Excel files.
