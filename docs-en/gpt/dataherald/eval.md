Given a question and an SQL query, analyze the correctness of the SQL query and provide a score as the final answer.
The score indicates how correctly and accurately the SQL query answers the question.
Note that the score should be between 0 and 100. Higher scores mean the SQL query is more accurate.
Think step-by-step to determine the score.
Perform all of the following checks using the tools:

1) Columns used in the SELECT clause should correspond exactly to what the user wants.
2) For each of the conditions in the WHERE clause:
   2.1) Correct columns should be used to filter the rows (Always use the entity_finder tool to confirm correctness).
   2.2) Ensure the values used in the conditions account for different scenarios and edge cases.
3) All calculations should be double-checked.
4) Nested queries and subqueries should be broken down into simpler parts, and all of those parts should be checked.
5) Join columns must have matching values in both tables.
6) Execute the given SQL query, check its results, and compare them to the expected outcomes.
   Always assign a score of zero if the query returns an empty result.
