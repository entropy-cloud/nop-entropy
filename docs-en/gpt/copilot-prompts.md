1. Variable naming: provide ten candidate options and explain them

2. Rapid code reading

“From an architectural design perspective, analyze the design approach of this code and explain the pros and cons of this approach.”
“Analyze the detailed logic of the xxx function and its role within the entire file.”
“Add comments to every line of the xxx function to provide a detailed breakdown of the function.”
“I need to modify this file to implement the xxx feature; how should I change it?”
“I need to rewrite this Python code in TypeScript; provide a detailed analysis of the design logic of this Python code and explain how to implement it in TypeScript.”
“Identify the potential risks in this code.”
“In this code, what is the difference between the run and test methods?”

3. Code rewrite: implement the overall logic using the xx library

“Here is the documentation for this function from the b library; help me rewrite this part that was implemented with the a library.”
“Here is an official example from the b library. I want to use b to implement the xx feature; please implement it for me.”

4. Development templates

“I need a TypeScript class; its usage and invocation are: \<pseudocode\>; please implement a minimal version.”
“Inside this class, I want to record xxx data produced incrementally. What structure best fits TypeScript’s programming model? Please design it and explain your reasoning.”
“This is the class/architecture/data structure I designed for xxx. Provide five pros and five cons, and explain each in detail.”

5. Error analysis
   “Explain this error and analyze the possible causes and how to fix it.”
   “I don’t think this is the root cause of the error. Based on your knowledge, provide three possible root causes.”

6. Design optimization
   “These are my senior’s comments on my PR. Help me analyze their meaning and propose appropriate solutions.”

“Does the design of this class account for the xxx issue?”
“Analyze whether this class has any security risks.”
“… in which scenarios might there be leakage risks?”
“How can this class be optimized for xxx?”

7. Basic setup
   “I’m going to write a Node.js library. Help me create a basic Rollup configuration, tsconfig, and package.json configuration.” “Help me write a basic xxx component using React.”

8. Learning
   A few very useful magic words: “Explain in detail with examples,” “Compare these two in detail, listing pros and cons,” “Provide real-world scenarios to contrast the differences between these two,” “Using the xxx function, write a simple demo and introduce its advantages.”
