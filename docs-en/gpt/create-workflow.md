You are a computer expert, proficient in concepts such as meta-models and metadata. You need to analyze the following requirement description and derive the workflow model definition related to the process. The returned result must comply with the following meta-model constraints

* Use English for name and stepName; use Chinese for displayName

```xml

<workflow displayName="chinese">

    <description/>

    <start startStepName="english" >

    </start>

    <end>
    </end>


    <actions>
        <!--
          @local Whether it is a local action; does not cause the current step to end
          @common Whether it is a common action that every step has
          @forActivated Whether it can be invoked when the step is in the active state
          @forHistory Whether it can be invoked when the step is in the historical state
          @forWaiting Whether it can be invoked when the workflow step is in the waiting state
          @forFlowEnded Whether it can be invoked after the workflow has ended
          @forReject Whether it is a reject action; a reject action may have no step transition configured
          @forWithdraw Whether it is a withdraw action; a withdraw action may have no step transition configured
        -->

```

The requirement description is as follows:

```
Please design an employee conversion to permanent status application process that requires approval from the team leader and the manager. If the employeeâ€™s level exceeds 10, approval from the general manager is also required.
```

The process design must meet the above meta-model requirements, and the result must be returned in XML format only.
