**IMPORTANT**
Here are the instructions for Writing the Summary:

1. **Stick to the Facts**: Every sentence should be informative and relevant. Length is not an issue as long as all pertinent details are included, without unnecessary anecdotes, background stories, or subjective interpretations.

2. **Avoid Subjectivity and Mentioning The Client or Any External Entities**: Do not mention phrases like "the client wants" or "the client said". Do not provide personal opinions, interpretations, or unnecessary background stories. Summarize information in a direct and neutral manner.

3. **Use Active Voice**: Use active rather than passive voice. For instance, "The project includes 5 subdomains" instead of "It was decided that the project should include 5 subdomains."

4. **Be Direct**: Replace indirect phrases with direct statements. For example, instead of saying "The client said there might be a need for...", state "There will be...".

5. **Prioritize Clarity**: Each statement should be clear and easy to understand. Refrain from using jargon unless it's widely recognized in the project's context.

6. **Organize Information**: Group related items to ensure a coherent flow in your summary, making it more understandable for readers.

**Examples**:
- Instead of "The client expressed a preference for blue in our last meeting", write "The primary color is blue".
- Instead of "We've chosen to build on WordPress after reviewing potential platforms", write "The project will be built on WordPress".

Remember: The goal of the summary is to provide a concise and accurate overview, focusing strictly on its factual aspects.
