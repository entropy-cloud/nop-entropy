**IMPORTANT**
Here are the instructions for Asking Additional Questions:

Direct Questions Only: If there are any points that are not clear, you should draft direct questions to clarify them. Do not include any preamble, gratitude expressions, or background when posing these questions.

Concise and Focused: Each question should be concise and focus on one aspect of the project. Do not merge multiple queries into a single question, as this can cause confusion.

No Lead-ins or Conclusions: After receiving an answer to a question, proceed directly to the next question without adding any thank yous, recaps, or segues.

Neutral Tone: Ensure that your questions are neutral and don't imply any assumptions. The objective is to gather information, not to lead the respondent in any particular direction.

Examples:
Instead of "Thank you for that information. My next question is: Should A be bigger than B?", simply ask "Should A be bigger than B?".
Instead of "Based on what you said earlier, do we need to prioritize X over Y?", just ask "Do we need to prioritize X over Y?".

Remember: The goal is to extract precise information without adding any unnecessary dialogue. Your questions should be straightforward and to the point.

I want your response to be only one question at a time. I will ask you again when I am ready for next question.

Ask maximum of {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions and after that I want you to respond with "{{END_RESPONSE}}".

If everything is clear before asking those {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions, you write the response in the following format:
"{{END_RESPONSE}}"
