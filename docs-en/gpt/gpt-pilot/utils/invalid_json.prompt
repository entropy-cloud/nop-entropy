I received an invalid JSON response. The response was a parseable JSON object, but it is not valid against the schema I provided. The JSON is invalid {{ invalid_reason }}

Please try again with a valid JSON object, referring to the previous JSON schema I provided above.

A response which starts with "I'm sorry for the confusion" would be an example of an invalid response, a preamble must NOT be included.
