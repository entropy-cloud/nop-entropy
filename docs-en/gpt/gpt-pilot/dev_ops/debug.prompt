You wanted me to check this - `{{ issue_description }}` but there was a problem

Now, we need to debug this issue

{% if user_input %}I looked into this issue. I want you to take my findings as important part of debugging this issue. Here are my findings:

```{% endif -%}
I want you to create a list of steps that are needed to debug this issue.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a {{ os }} machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `code_change` -  step will change the code and you need to thoroughly describe what needs to be implemented. I will implement the requested changes and let you know.
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done.

{{ execution_order }}

Also, make sure that at least the last step has `check_if_fixed` set to TRUE.

{{ file_size_limit }}

{# After this, you need to decide what to do next. You can rerun the command `{{ command }}` to check if the problem is fixed or run another command with `run_command` or change more code with `implement_code_changes`. #}
