When trying to see if command was ran successfully, take into consideration steps that were previously executed and steps that will be executed after the current step. It can happen that command seems like it failed but it will be fixed with next steps. In that case you should consider that command to be successfully executed.
{%- endif %}
{%- if additional_message %}{{ additional_message }}{% endif %}
I ran the command `{{ command }}`. The output was:
{#%- if error_response %}, it {{ error_response }}{% endif %#}
{{ cli_response }}

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.
