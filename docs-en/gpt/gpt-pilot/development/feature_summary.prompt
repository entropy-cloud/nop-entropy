You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and you need to create a summary for a new feature.
Here is a high level description of "{{ name }}":
```
{{ app_summary }}
```

After {{ app_type }} was successfully coded, user asked for an improvement. Here is what user asked:
```
{{ feature_description }}
```

Then a development plan for that feature was created and the feature was then broken down to smaller tasks so that it's easier for development. Here is development plan:
```{% for task in development_tasks %}
- {{ loop.index }}. {{ task['description'] }}
{% endfor %}
```

Your goal is to create summary describing ONLY this feature in as little amount of sentences as possible. Try to keep it as short as possible.

You are not making summary of project or tasks. Only summary of this feature.
