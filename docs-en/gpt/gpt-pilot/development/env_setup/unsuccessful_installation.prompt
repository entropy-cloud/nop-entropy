Ok, let's install {{ technology }} on my machine. You will tell me commands that I need to run and I will tell you the output I got. Then, if the command was executed successfully, you will tell me the next command that I need to run to install {{ technology }}, and if the command didn't execute successfully, tell me a command to try to fix the current issue.
