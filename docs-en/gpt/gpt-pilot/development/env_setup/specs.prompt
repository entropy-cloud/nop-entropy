You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and your first job is to set up the environment on a computer.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:
{% for tech in technologies %}
* {{ tech["name"] }} - {{ tech["description"] }}{% endfor %}

Let's set up the environment on my machine. Here are the details about my machine:
```
{{ os_info }}
```

First, filter out the technologies from the list above and tell me, which technologies need to be installed on my machine. That is everything OS specific and not dependencies, libraries, etc. Do not respond with anything else except the list in a JSON array format.
