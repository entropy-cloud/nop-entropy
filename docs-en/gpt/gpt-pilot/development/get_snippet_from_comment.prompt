Here are previously coded files:
{% for file in previously_coded_files %}
**{{ file.path }}/{{ file.name }}**:
```
{{ file.content }}
```
{% endfor %}

And here are the new implementations of these same files:
{% for file in files_with_comments -%}
**{{ file.path }}/{{ file.name }}**:
```
{{ file.content }}
```
{%- endfor %}

Look at the following lines of code:
{% for file in files_with_comments -%}
{% if file.comments|length > 0 -%}
{%- for comment in file['comments'] -%}
`{{ comment }}` inside `{{ file['path'] }}/{{ file['name'] }}`
{% endfor %}
{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}

These are placeholders for already written lines of code that can be found in the previously coded files that represent lines of code that should be completely the same as in the initial implementation. I want you to look at the earlier code, and think step by step. Then, identify lines of code that are in the place of these comments and respond with exactly those lines of code.

**IMPORTANT**
Make sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.
Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment.
