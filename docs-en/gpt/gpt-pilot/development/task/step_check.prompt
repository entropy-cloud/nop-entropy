Now, we need to verify if this change was successfully implemented. We can do that in 2 ways:
{#1. By writing an automated test or by running a previously written test - you write automated tests in Jest and you always try finding a way to test a functionality with an automated test. Even if changes seem visual or UI-based, try to find a way to validate them using an automated test, such as verifying HTTP responses or elements rendered on the page. If you choose this type of test, make sure that you describe it in as much details as needed so that when someone looks at this test can know exactly what needs to be done to implement this automated test.#}

1. By running a command (or multiple commands) - this is good for when an automated test is an overkill. For example, if we installed a new package or changed some configuration. Keep in mind that in this case, there shouldn't be any human intervention needed - I will run the commands you will give me and show you the CLI output and from that, you should be able to determine if the test passed or failed.

2. By requesting that a human checks if everything works as expected - this is the last option that we want to avoid but if we can't test the functionality programmatically, we should ask a human to check if it works as expected. For example, if something was visually changed in the UI. If you have any option to test the code change with an automated test or a command, you always do it. Manual test is the last resort that should be avoided if possible.

Ok, now, tell me how can we verify if this change was successful and respond only with a keyword for a type of test.
