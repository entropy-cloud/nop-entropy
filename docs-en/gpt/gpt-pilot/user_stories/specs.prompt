I want you to create {{ app_type }} (let's call it "{{ name }}") that can be described like this:
```
{{ prompt }}
```

Think step by step about the description for the {{ app_type }} "{{ name }}" and the additional questions and answers and break down user stories. You will think about the {{ app_type }} description and the answers listed and create a list of all user stories. A user story is a description of how a user can interact with the {{ app_type }}. For example, if an app's description is `Create a script that finds Youtube channels with the word "test" inside the channel name`, user stories could be:
- `user will run the script from the CLI`
- `user will get the list of all channels in a CSV file`

**IMPORTANT**
Return one user story at the time. Do not return anything else but single user story. I might ask you to modify some user stories and only when I send you empty response you can move to next user story.

**IMPORTANT**
Once you are done creating all user stories, write the response containing nothing else but this:
{{END_RESPONSE}}
