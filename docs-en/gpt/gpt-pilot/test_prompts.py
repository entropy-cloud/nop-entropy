I ran the command `./scripts/run_tests`. The output was:

stdout:
```
success
```

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.
