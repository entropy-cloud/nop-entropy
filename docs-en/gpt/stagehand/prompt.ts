1. Break down complex actions into individual atomic steps
2. For \`act\` commands, use only one action at a time, such as:
   - Single click on a specific element

   - Select a single option
3. Avoid combining multiple actions in one instruction
4. If multiple actions are needed, they should be separate steps`,
