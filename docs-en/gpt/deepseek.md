I want xx, for xx to use, hoping to achieve xx effect, but worried about xx issues...

I need to write a weekly report; the boss will read it on Monday. I want to focus on xxx, mainly to make our department look impressive in front of the boss and outshine the R&D department next door, but I'm worried R&D will question that our product documentation isn't detailed enough……"

Next week I have to negotiate with BYD’s supplier, but I know nothing about power batteries. Help me explain in the most plain language:
1. Where their technical advantages are
2. What they might ask for in pricing
3. What professional terms can be used in negotiation
The priority is that I can understand it and look like an insider.

Speak plainly.

Please output according to the following specifications: 1. Use plain, direct language; avoid abstract metaphors. 2. Use everyday, scenario-based examples to aid explanation. 3. Prefer concrete nouns over abstract concepts. 4. Keep paragraphs concise (no more than 5 lines). 5. Provide a plain explanation alongside technical statements. 6. Do not use literary rhetoric. 7. Put key information up front. 8. Break down complex content into bullet points. 9. Keep a conversational tone without oversimplifying professional content. 10. Under the premise of accuracy, prefer commonly understood vocabulary.

Please conduct at least 10 rounds of critical thinking in your thinking and analysis process, and be thorough; simultaneously consider your answer from the opposite perspective for at least 10 rounds, and be thorough; also review your answer for at least 10 rounds, and be thorough.

Imitate xxx’s writing style and write an xx genre piece about xxxxx.


**Four-Quadrant Question Classification Model**
Based on the axes of **Objective–Subjective** (horizontal) and **Certain–Uncertain** (vertical), human questions are categorized to form four cognitive dimensions:

1. **What is (Fact Confirmation)**
- **Type**: Objective fact checking (e.g., "What is the boiling point of water?")
- **AI role**: Invoke knowledge graphs to provide precise answers.

2. **Why/How (Logical Reasoning)**
- **Type**: Causal analysis (e.g., "Why is global warming intensifying?")
- **AI role**: Start a causal reasoning engine and build multivariable associations.

3. **What if (Practical Strategy)**
- **Type**: Scenario simulation (e.g., "If starting a business, how should one plan?")
- **AI role**: Run probabilistic simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo) to dynamically weigh strategies.

4. **Beyond (Boundary Breakthrough)**
- **Type**: Disruptive thinking (e.g., "Is time a human illusion?")
- **Human role**: Lead with intuition and innovation to trigger paradigm shifts.

**Core Value**:
- **Dynamic evolution**: Cognition spirals upward from facts → inference → strategy → breakthrough, driving scientific and social innovation (e.g., the history of AI development).
- **Human–AI collaboration**: AI leads in the first two quadrants (precise, efficient); humans intervene in the last two quadrants (breaking limitations).
- **Thinking diagnosis**: Balance across quadrants to avoid cognitive bias (e.g., if overly reliant on facts, strengthen breakthrough training).
