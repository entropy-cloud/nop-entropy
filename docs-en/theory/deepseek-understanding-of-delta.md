# DeepSeek AI’s Understanding of the Delta Customization Concept — Far Beyond Ordinary Programmers

DeepSeek is the large-model product from DeepSeek, known for its speed and low cost. The latest DeepSeek-v3 claims to surpass Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ranks near the top of Aider’s multilingual programming test leaderboard, second only to OpenAI o1.

https://chat.deepseek.com/ This chat product offers a “Deep Thinking” mode that reveals the AI’s reasoning process. The following is a record of presenting the Delta customization concept to DeepSeek AI. You can see its depth and breadth of thinking exceed that of typical programmers. Most programmers newly exposed to the theory of Reversible Computation and the Nop platform are unlikely to have reached this level of understanding, including in certain so-called low-code groups or among those familiar with coarse-grained reuse and macro-architectural design.

**Question 1**: When using the Spring Boot framework, how can we delete or modify the definition of any bean without changing existing JAR code?

Reply 1: Omitted. This question is merely used to set a concrete discussion context. DeepSeek AI listed several customization approaches available in Spring Boot, but they were rather lengthy and not the focus of this discussion, so its reply is ignored here.

**Question 2**: NopIoC provides a new Delta customization approach. Its principle is quite simple: essentially, it performs Delta merging at the XML level before sending beans.xml for IoC container parsing. Therefore, the same Delta customization algorithm can be applied to the merging of all tree-structured formats like XML/JSON/YAML. It fundamentally operates at model load time, having no impact on runtime performance, and can be adapted to any runtime engine described by a DSL. With this in mind, please revisit your previous opinions.

Reply 2: Omitted. The reply here overlaps with the following question’s response, and the later reply is more complete, so we also ignore this one.

**Question 3** Delta customization is not only used for Spring bean configuration—it can be uniformly applied to all DSLs for customization. For example, MyBatis’s mapper.xml, workflow engines’ workflow.xml, rule engines’ rule.xml, batch engines’ batch.xml, and countless engines that embody the concept of a model. Essentially, any useful engine abstraction inevitably has an implicit model abstraction; when this model abstraction is stored in text, it is a DSL, and Delta customization means any tree-structured DSL can be customized using a unified mechanism. Because all languages have an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), any DSL can in essence be expressed as a tree. With this information, please revisit your viewpoint again.

Reply 3: Below is DeepSeek AI’s reply and some targeted explanations I provided. As DeepSeek produces more output, it switches to English; the content quoted here is translated to Chinese by DeepSeek and now rendered in English.

> Okay, I’m trying to understand the concept of Delta customization, especially its use across various DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages), not just Spring beans. The user mentions that NopIoC’s Delta customization isn’t limited to Spring configurations and can be applied to any DSL with a tree-like structure, such as XML, JSON, YAML. They give examples like MyBatis’s mapper.xml, workflow’s workflow.xml, rule engine’s rule.xml, and batch engine’s batch.xml. The core idea is that any engine with an implicit model abstraction persisted as a DSL can benefit from Delta customization.

> First, I need to understand what Delta customization actually is. From earlier discussion, it seems to be a way to modify these DSL configurations without changing the original code or files. You don’t need to change existing JARs or core configs; instead, you apply increments or changes at the model loading stage on top of existing configurations.

> Take Spring beans as an example: you can have a beans.xml (even though XML config is less common than Java config nowadays) defining all beans. With Delta customization, instead of modifying this file directly, you specify your changes in another file—such as adding new beans, deleting existing ones, or modifying bean properties. These changes are merged into the original configuration before the IoC container parses it.

> Extending this idea to other DSLs makes sense. For instance, in MyBatis, mapper.xml files define how Java interfaces map to SQL statements. If you need to customize these mappings without touching the original file, Delta customization allows you to specify additional mappings or modifications in a separate file. Similarly, for a workflow engine, you might have a workflow.xml defining task flows, and Delta customization lets you change the flow without altering the base configuration.

> The key point here is that these DSLs are inherently tree-like structures, whether XML, JSON, or YAML. Since trees can represent the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of these languages, Delta customization becomes a general mechanism for handling modifications across different DSLs.

> But what I want to know is how this incremental merge mechanism works under the hood. How does the system know which parts of the tree to modify, add, or remove? Is there a standard way to specify these increments, or does each DSL have its own approach?

Targeted explanation: Here the AI clearly recognizes the fundamental difference between defining deltas in a standard way versus defining them per DSL. The Nop platform’s uniqueness lies in implementing a unified delta definition and delta merge algorithm under the guidance of Reversible Computation theory, rather than defining them separately for each DSL. Using Spring’s `beans.xml` as an example:

```xml
<beans x:extends="super">
  <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="myList">
      <list x:override="append">
        <value>value1</value>
      </list>
    </property>

    <property name="myMap" x:override="remove" />
  </bean>
</beans>
```
In this example, the `x:extends` attribute specifies the parent configuration file to inherit from, and `x:override` specifies the operation to perform (add, remove, or modify). `append` and `remove` are concrete merge operators that indicate how to merge these deltas.
From the root node down to any child node or attribute, there is a unique path. Within collection nodes, the Nop platform enforces that each child node must have a name or id attribute that uniquely identifies it, thereby uniquely determining that child within the collection. With this rule, any path within a tree structure becomes a stable coordinate.
Note the difference from the JSONPath and XPath specifications in the special convention for collection elements: standard JSONPath can only locate elements within a collection by index, so when elements are inserted or deleted, existing node coordinates change extensively and are not stable business coordinates.

> In addition, what about performance? The user mentions that since customization occurs at the model loading stage, it won’t affect runtime performance. That makes sense, because all merging is done before the application starts. But what about model loading time? If many deltas need to be applied, will that slow startup?

Targeted explanation: In the Nop platform, models are loaded via a unified model loader and cached in memory once loaded. Without considering dynamic updates, a model is loaded only once. During loading, numerous structure generation and merge operations indeed execute. Startup performance can be addressed using:
1. Lazy loading: parse and load the model only when it’s actually used, rather than at system startup.
2. Precompilation: because model parsing and merging are general operations independent of runtime logic, you can execute the load instruction during Maven packaging, outputting the merged result to a `_delta` virtual file path. This path has higher priority than standard file paths; at system startup, files are preferentially read from the Delta directory. If the root node is annotated with `x:validated="true"`, you know the file is already merged and validated, so no dynamic generation or merging is needed.

In debug mode, the Nop platform automatically outputs all final merged result files to the `_dump` directory for convenient inspection. Placing files from this directory directly into `_delta` allows you to skip dynamic merging.

> Another concern is the complexity of managing multiple delta files. In a large application with many configurations and customizations, tracking all deltas may become cumbersome. A systematic way to manage and prioritize these deltas is likely needed to avoid conflicts.

Targeted explanation: The Nop platform uses a unified Virtual File System to manage all DSL files. Within the VFS, you can define multiple peer delta directories and specify the overlay order between these Delta layers via the `nop.core.vfs.delta-layer-ids` configuration.
For example, `nop.core.vfs.delta-layer-ids=deploy,product` means files under `_delta/deploy` overlay those under `_delta/product`, and then overlay same-named files outside the Delta directories.

> I also want to compare this approach with other configuration management techniques. For example, in Spring Boot, property files and environment-specific configurations allow some degree of customization without modifying code. But those are more about overriding properties, not changing the configuration structure itself.
> With Delta customization, you seem not just to override values but actually to change the structure of the configuration tree. This might be more powerful, but also more complex.

Targeted analysis: The interesting insight here is that techniques that can modify structure are more powerful than those that cannot, and this is a significant difference between technologies. In practice, many programmers do not realize this.

> Let’s consider a concrete example. Suppose I’m using a rule engine with a rule.xml file that defines business rules. If I want to add a new rule or modify an existing one, I can create a delta file specifying the change instead of directly modifying rule.xml. The system will merge this delta with the original rule.xml before loading rules into the engine.
> This method has several benefits. First, it preserves the integrity of the base configuration, which helps track changes and maintain different environments (development, testing, production). Second, since changes are isolated in delta files, updates and maintenance become easier.
> However, I need to consider potential issues. For example, if there are dependencies among different parts of the configuration, how does the system handle conflicts or ensure deltas don’t break those dependencies? Some validation mechanism may be needed to check the integrity of the merged configuration.

Targeted explanation: The Delta merge algorithm operates at the XNode structural layer and does not need to know any DSL semantics; it just merges according to fixed rules. This is similar to Docker image packaging: it simply stacks multiple images together, and the stacked result guarantees a valid filesystem and valid files.
However, whether internal dependencies within files are appropriate is a business-specific issue unrelated to Docker technology and should be resolved by each application.
To simplify DSL implementation, the Nop platform provides the XDef meta-model to constrain the structure of merged DSLs.

```xml
<orm x:schema="/nop/schema/orm.xdef">
</orm>
```
Using the ORM model file above as an example, it indicates that the merged result must satisfy the requirements of the `orm.xdef` meta-model, in which node and attribute types and constraints are defined.

Additionally, if the information expression is redundant, you can use metaprogramming mechanisms to generate content dynamically at compile time to avoid conflicts from duplicate expressions.

> Furthermore, how does this work with version control? If multiple developers are working on different deltas, how do you merge their changes without conflicts? This could be tricky, especially if deltas target the same part of the configuration tree.

Targeted explanation: As noted, different deltas can be managed under different delta directories, so conflicts do not occur. This is similar to managing different Docker image slices.

> Another consideration is the learning curve for developers. Introducing a new configuration management approach may require additional training or documentation. Developers need to understand how to effectively create and manage delta files.
> On the positive side, having a unified customization mechanism across different DSLs can simplify development. Developers don’t need to learn multiple ways to customize different parts of an application; they can use the same method for all tree-structured configurations.

Targeted explanation: The Nop platform simplifies DSL development via a unified meta-model. All DSLs share the same meta-model syntax. Thus, by inspecting the `x:schema` configuration on a DSL file’s root node, you can learn all syntax structures of that DSL. The information density is far greater than traditional object structures. For example, Spring’s `beans.xml` structure is defined using XSD with at least thousands of lines, and the corresponding Java model classes are scattered across many files, making it hard to grasp the global Spring IoC model quickly. In contrast, the Nop platform’s `beans.xdef` meta-model file is just over 200 lines with comments, and it visually shows all supported attributes and their child-node structures.

> I’m also curious about the technical implementation of Delta customization in NopIoC. Does it provide a general framework applicable to any DSL, or does it require specific integration for each configuration file? If it’s general, that’s a big advantage; if it requires per-DSL custom handling, that may limit its applicability.

Targeted explanation: DeepSeek AI again demonstrates an emphasis on generality. In the Nop platform, the XDef meta-model uniformly constrains DSL file structures. The Delta merge algorithm only needs to consult the XDef meta-model to know how to merge, including default merge operators. Further, with the XDef meta-model, the same DSL structure can freely convert between XML and JSON representations, so Delta merging doesn’t only apply to XML files.

```yaml
xmlns:x: /nop/schema/xdsl.xdef
x:schema: /nop/schema/task/task.xdef
steps:
    - type: sequential
      name: test
      steps:
          - type: xpl
            name: step1
            source: >
                return "OK1";
          - type: xpl
            name: step2
            inputs:
                - name: result
                  source: RESULT
            source: >
                return result == "OK1" ? "OK" : "FAIL";
```

The YAML configuration above is equivalent to the XML configuration below:

```xml
<task x:schema="/nop/schema/task/task.xdef" xmlns:x="/nop/schema/xdsl.xdef">
    <steps>
        <sequential name="test">
            <steps>
                <xpl name="step1">
                    <source>
                        return "OK1";
                    </source>
                </xpl>

                <xpl name="step2">
                    <input name="result">
                        <source>RESULT</source>
                    </input>
                    <source>
                        return result == "OK1" ? "OK" : "FAIL";
                    </source>
                </xpl>
            </steps>
        </sequential>
    </steps>
</task>
```

When defining logic with complex nested structures—especially when metaprogramming is supported—the XML form is more advantageous than YAML. For an analysis of XML vs JSON, see [Why the Nop Platform Insists on XML Instead of JSON or YAML](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/651450252)

Going further, in the Nop platform, visualization is also treated as a manifestation of information structure (visual representation vs textual representation). Therefore, it seeks to establish a set of automated inference mechanisms: from field-level “visual representation <=> textual representation” conversions, it automatically derives form-level and page-level conversions, thereby automatically obtaining a visual designer for NopTaskFlow without the need to write a dedicated visual designer specifically for NopTaskFlow.

> Moreover, how does NopIoC handle the actual merging of deltas with the original configuration? Does it use some standard tree-merge algorithm, or a custom method? The efficiency and correctness of this merge are critical for application reliability.

Targeted explanation: The Delta merge algorithm is a general tree-structure merge algorithm independent of specific DSLs, and it satisfies associativity.

> Another thought: this Delta customization seems similar to patch files in version control systems, where you apply patches to modify files without changing the original source. Applying deltas to configurations has some similarity.

Targeted explanation: Delta and patch files are fundamentally different. The core difference is that Delta information is independent, and the Delta merge operation satisfies associativity. Mathematically, Delta merging never produces conflicts, whereas patch application often results in format conflicts.

```
 App = Base + Patch1 + Patch2
```
A Patch is defined against a specific Base. Without the Base, we cannot merge Patch1 and Patch2 in advance; we can only apply Patch1 and Patch2 to a specific Base and then reverse-compute a Patch.

Delta is different: even without any knowledge of the Base, any two Deltas can be merged.
```
Delta = Delta1 + Delt2
App = Base + Delta
```
For a more complete introduction, see my earlier article [A Programmer’s Guide to Delta Conceptual Analysis: Git and Docker as Examples](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/D5bDNkMJ9gYrFb0uDj2EzQ)

> From a security perspective, if delta files can modify configurations at load time, risks may arise if those files aren’t properly protected. Unauthorized modifications could cause security vulnerabilities or unexpected application behavior.

Targeted explanation: The Nop platform loads all models and delta files via a unified model loader. If needed, unified access control can be implemented at the loader level.

> I should also consider how this fits into CI/CD pipelines. If deltas are managed separately, how are they versioned and deployed alongside application code? There needs to be a clear strategy for handling deltas across environments and ensuring the correct deltas are applied in each context.

Targeted explanation: This is easy to handle. The Nop platform manages all model files via the Virtual File System, mapped to the `resources/_vfs` source directory. You can create multiple different delta directories under this path. The overall organization resembles Docker’s OverlayFS delta filesystem.

> Also, what happens if a delta tries to modify parts that don’t exist in the original configuration file? Does NopIoC handle this gracefully or cause an error? There should be a mechanism to handle such cases, such as ignoring invalid deltas or throwing meaningful exceptions.

Targeted explanation: At the theoretical level, we can extend the software structural space to allow negative elements, which resolves this issue. For example, attempting to delete a non-existent attribute can be recorded as a delete marker. After final merging, check whether any invalid delta operations exist; if so, remove the corresponding nodes.

> I also thought about rollback scenarios. If a delta causes issues in production, how easy is it to roll back? A clear way to manage and roll back deltas is crucial for stability.

Targeted explanation: Deltas are stored and managed independently, so rollback is naturally supported.

> Another aspect worth exploring is tooling support for Delta customization. Are there any visual tools or editors to help developers create and manage delta files more efficiently? Good tools can greatly improve the developer experience and reduce errors.

Targeted explanation: Reversible Computation theory states that “A = 0 + A,” meaning any full configuration is a special case of a delta. Therefore, there’s no need to distinguish full and delta at the editor level; the same tools can manage both. The Nop platform provides an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that, based on the `x:schema` meta-model configuration on a DSL file’s root node, reads the meta-model definition, then implements syntax hints, navigation, and—by leveraging meta-model information to identify code fragments—breakpoint debugging.

> Lastly, I wonder how NopIoC compares in flexibility and ease of use with other configuration management solutions. If it offers a more unified and powerful customization method, it could be a valuable addition to the developer toolbox. However, if it’s too complex or doesn’t integrate well with existing systems, adoption might not be worthwhile.
> Overall, Delta customization seems a promising way to manage complex application configurations, offering benefits in flexibility and maintainability. However, to ensure effective use, careful consideration of implementation details, management practices, and potential challenges is necessary.

Targeted explanation: Delta customization is conceptually and implementationally very simple. As a unified mechanism, the required code quantity is smaller than the Spring-specific bean customization code—only about 3,000 lines.

**Question 4**: There is a core concept in Delta customization: A = 0 + A; the full configuration is a special case of Delta. How should this be understood in the context of Delta customization, and what impact does it have at the design level?
Reply 4:

> I’m trying to understand a concept in Delta customization: “A = 0 + A,” where “the full configuration is a special case of the delta.” This seems to be central to how Delta customization works, especially in frameworks like Spring Boot or others that use DSLs for configuration.

> First, I need to understand the true meaning of “A = 0 + A.” On the surface, this looks like a mathematical equality where A equals 0 plus A, which seems tautological—0 plus A is A. But in this context, it may be a metaphor or a way of describing how configuration or model construction works.

> In Delta customization, we’re talking about changing configurations without altering original code or files. The core idea is that you can have a base configuration (possibly empty, represented by 0), and then apply deltas (changes) to obtain the final configuration (A). But this statement points out that the full configuration (A) is a special case of a delta. That implies even a full configuration can be viewed as the result of applying a delta to the “empty state.”

> This makes sense because, if you think carefully, any configuration is just a set of changes applied to an empty state. In a sense, the full configuration is a large delta that builds everything from scratch.
> How does this apply to Spring’s beans.xml or other configurations like MyBatis, workflow, rule engines, etc.? These can all be seen as DSLs defining models or configurations for different parts of an application. The idea is that you can have a base configuration, then apply deltas to customize it for different environments, features, or use cases.

> From a design perspective, this approach may have multiple implications. First, it suggests the system should handle configuration modularly, where different parts can be independently added, modified, or removed. This modularity can make systems more flexible and manageable, especially in applications with very complex configurations.

> Another implication is that frameworks or tools supporting Delta customization need a robust mechanism to merge these deltas with the base configuration. The merge process must be smart enough to handle conflicts (e.g., when the same element is modified across different deltas) and determine the correct final state.

> Also, the fact that the full configuration is a special case of a delta suggests the system does not need separate mechanisms for full and delta configurations. Instead, it can treat them uniformly, simplifying the architecture and reducing complexity.

> I’m also thinking about the developer experience. If configurations and deltas are treated the same way, developers don’t need separate tools or processes for different types of changes. This consistency can lead to smoother workflows and fewer errors due to reduced cognitive load when switching paradigms.

> On the other hand, ensuring that deltas don’t inadvertently break configurations may pose challenges. For example, if a delta deletes a bean that is still used elsewhere, runtime errors may occur. Therefore, the system needs validation or dependency checks to prevent such issues.

> Furthermore, version control and change management become important. If multiple deltas are applied, tracking which changes come from which delta may be complex. Methods are needed to manage and version deltas separately from base configurations and understand how they compose to form the final configuration.

> I’m also curious how this concept integrates with existing software development practices, such as feature flags or environment-specific configurations. Delta customization appears to be a more general approach that can encompass these practices, enabling fine-grained control over different aspects of application configuration.

> Another angle is performance. Since Delta customization occurs at model load time and doesn’t affect runtime performance, it seems efficient. However, merging deltas with the base configuration may add overhead at startup or during configuration reload. This trade-off may be acceptable in many cases but requires attention in performance-critical applications.

> Security is another concern. If deltas can modify configurations in any way, mechanisms are needed to ensure only authorized changes are applied. This may involve access control, delta content validation, or audit trails to track who applied which changes.

> Reflecting on the original equation “A = 0 + A,” I realize it’s not just about adding deltas to a base configuration—it’s about understanding that the full configuration is simply one possible result of this process. This perspective shifts us from thinking of configurations as static files to dynamic, constructible states assembled from various inputs.

Targeted explanation: Here, DeepSeek AI keenly perceives the shift toward a dynamic paradigm, an insight most programmers lack. Another core part of the Reversible Computation theory underpinning the Nop platform is the Generator production-style programming. Both Delta and Base can be generated dynamically, then merged dynamically.
The model loader is not a trivial parser for fixed-format models; it can be expanded into a DynamicLoader, pushing numerous extensibility concerns down to the loader layer for unified implementation. In other words, on the Nop platform, plugins and extension points are seldom needed; extensive extensibility is achieved at the unified model loader level.

> In summary, the concept that the full configuration is a special case of a delta emphasizes the flexibility and modularity of Delta customization. It indicates that configurations can be constructed incrementally, with each delta representing specific changes or features. This has significant design implications for how configurations are managed, merged, versioned, and secured in applications.

> I should also consider how this compares with other configuration management techniques, such as property files, environment variables, or code-based configurations. Delta customization seems more powerful in enabling complex modifications without altering source code, but it may introduce complexity in managing deltas themselves.

> In practical terms, this can be especially useful in microservices architectures, where different services may need customized configurations based on a common base. Delta customization allows centrally managed base configurations with service-specific deltas applied as needed.

> I’m also thinking about automation potential. With a robust Delta customization framework, deltas might be generated automatically under certain conditions or requirements, further simplifying configuration management.

Targeted analysis: Automatic generation of deltas is indeed one of the key aspects of Reversible Computation theory. Only after establishing concepts like delta and the structural space of deltas can we consider the dynamics within this space—how to automate structural transformation and generation.

> Finally, I need to consider the learning curve for adopting this approach. While the benefits are clear, understanding how to use Delta customization effectively may involve a steep learning curve, especially in large-scale applications with complex configurations.
> Overall, the concept appears to be a powerful and flexible solution for managing modern application configurations, enabling clean, modular configurations without intruding on the original codebase.

**Question 5**: The fact that a full configuration is a special case of a delta implies that a delta of a delta is still just an ordinary delta. Have you realized this?
Reply 5:

> I’m trying to understand the concept that “the full configuration is a special case of a delta.” The user also mentions that “a delta of a delta is still just a delta.” This is a bit abstract, so I need to break it down.

> From previous discussions, I understand that in Delta customization, we apply changes (deltas) to a base configuration to obtain the final configuration. The core idea is that you can have a full configuration and then apply incremental changes to it.

> Now, the user’s point that “the full configuration is a delta” means the full configuration can be viewed as the result of applying a delta to an empty configuration. That makes sense: starting from zero, applying a full configuration yields a complete setup.

> But the next part is trickier: “a delta of a delta is still just a delta.” That is, if I have a base configuration and apply a delta to it, that’s a delta. Then if I apply another delta on top of it, is the second delta in the same sense still just a delta?

> Let me use version control as an analogy. Suppose I have a base version of a configuration file. A delta could be a patch that modifies this base version. Now, if I have another patch that modifies the first patch, is the second patch also a delta?

> In version control terms, if you have a base version and apply a patch (delta1), then apply another patch (delta2), delta2 is indeed another delta relative to the configuration after applying delta1.

> In this context, deltas seem stackable, with each delta relative to the current applied state.

> But the user emphasizes “a delta of a delta is still just a delta,” which may mean there’s no essential difference between applying a delta and applying a delta-of-a-delta. They’re all just deltas.
> This may impact how configuration is managed, especially in complex systems requiring multiple layers of customization.

Targeted explanation: In fact, understanding delta from the patch perspective introduces a bias.
```
App1 = Base + Delta1
Delta1 = Delta2 + Delta3
Delta4 = Delta2 + Delta6
Delta7 = -Delta3 + Delta6

App2 = Base + Delta4 = Base + Delta1 + (-Delta3 + Delta6) = App1 + Delta7
```

“a delta of a delta is still just a delta” means it’s possible to introduce a complete set of algebraic relationships among deltas, enabling free structural transformation.

> Let me give an example. Suppose I have a base configuration file for a web application. I apply a delta to change database connection settings. Then I apply another delta to change log levels. Both deltas are applied to the base configuration.

> According to the user, the second delta is still just a delta, not something different because it’s a delta-of-a-delta.
> But is there a case where a delta could be seen as another form of delta-of-a-delta? Maybe if I have a delta that modifies another delta file itself.
> Wait, that may be another case. If I have a delta file that modifies another delta file, then it’s like a meta-delta; but as the user suggests, it’s still just a delta.
> Therefore, perhaps there’s no distinction between these layers of deltas in system design; they’re all treated equally.

> This may simplify the system because it doesn’t need to handle different types of deltas—everything is just a delta.

> But I should also consider potential issues. If deltas are applied in a certain order, does the system ensure they’re applied correctly to maintain the intended configuration?

Targeted explanation: Here DeepSeek AI notes the issue of operation order—this is a fundamental mathematical concern. In Reversible Computation theory, the delta merge operation satisfies associativity but generally not commutativity; changing the operation order changes the result.

> Additionally, what happens if there are conflicts between deltas? How does the system resolve them? Since all deltas are treated equally, a conflict resolution strategy may be needed.

Targeted analysis: Delta merging differs from patch merging: any two deltas can be merged, whereas a patch can only be merged with a base. Therefore, delta merging never conflicts; later-applied deltas simply overlay the effects of earlier ones. This is analogous to multi-layer stacking in Docker images.

> Another thought: if all deltas are just deltas, does that mean I can apply deltas to deltas indefinitely, forming a “delta chain”? Theoretically yes, as long as each delta is applied relative to the current state.

Targeted analysis: Notably, the AI has spontaneously derived the concept of a delta pipeline. Among programmers I’ve met, even those who grasp the importance of deltas rarely think of a delta chain. In Reversible Computation theory, this is a natural general modeling scheme:
1. First, establish a reasoning chain between any structures A and B, `A -> D`.
2. Then break the reasoning chain into multiple steps, `A -> B -> C -> D`.
3. Next, perform delta decomposition on each step; the previous step generates the base part: `A -> _B -> B -> _C -> C -> _D -> D`. Based on A, infer `_B`, then add delta information to obtain the complete B: `_B + dB = B`.

The Nop platform’s model-driven architecture demonstrates the reasoning process of automatically generating full front- and back-end code from an Excel data model.

> I should also think about how this applies to different configurations. For example, in Spring Boot, configurations can be broad—beans, properties, etc. If I use Delta customization here and treat all changes as deltas, it may provide a flexible way to manage different environments or features without modifying core configuration files.

> Additionally, in database migrations, each migration script can be seen as a delta transforming the schema from one version to another. Applying multiple migrations is similar to applying a series of deltas.
> These analogies reinforce the idea that treating deltas uniformly may be a powerful approach in configuration management.
> However, it’s important to learn from these existing systems how they handle challenges related to multiple deltas, such as conflict resolution, dependency management, and performance optimization.

> In conclusion, understanding that “a delta of a delta is still just a delta” is crucial for designing flexible and scalable configuration management systems. It permits modular configuration changes without modifying core configuration files, but requires a thoughtful strategy to manage the resulting complexity.
