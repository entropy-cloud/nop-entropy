1. Boundaries and limitations of Delta computation
Scope of applicability of Delta computation: Delta computation can theoretically be applied to any Tree-structured model file, but is its practical scope of applicability limited? For example, for certain complex business logic, Delta computation may become highly complex or even difficult to maintain. How to clearly define the scope of Delta computation and avoid overuse is a topic that requires further research.
Reversibility of Delta computation: Although Delta computation in XLang is theoretically reversible, how to ensure reversibility in practical applications—especially when dealing with complex business logic—is an issue that requires further study. For example, when Delta computation involves multiple layers of inheritance and overrides, how can we ensure the reversibility of the final result?

2. Complexity of Delta operations on Tree structures
Computational complexity of Delta operations on Tree structures: While Delta operations on Tree structures can theoretically achieve complex model generation and merging, what is the actual complexity in practice? In particular, when processing large model files, will the performance of Delta operations become a bottleneck? How to optimize Delta operations on Tree structures to improve performance and efficiency is a problem that needs to be addressed.
Maintainability of Delta operations on Tree structures: When handling complex business logic, Delta operations on Tree structures may make the model file structure highly complex. How to ensure the maintainability of such complex structures, especially in multi-person collaborative development scenarios, is an issue that needs careful consideration.

3. Limitations of the XDef metamodel definition language
Expressiveness of the XDef metamodel: Although the XDef metamodel definition language provides powerful structural constraints and validation capabilities, is it flexible enough to express complex business logic? For example, for dynamically generated model structures, can the XDef metamodel effectively constrain and validate them?
Extensibility of the XDef metamodel: Is the XDef metamodel definition language flexible enough when extending new DSLs? For instance, when new model structures or new model attributes need to be defined, can the XDef metamodel be conveniently extended and customized?

4. Interoperability with other languages and frameworks
Integration with existing systems: As an innovative programming language, how can XLang be seamlessly integrated with existing systems and frameworks (such as Spring, Hibernate, etc.)? Although XLang offers some integration schemes, compatibility issues may arise in practice. For example, how can we ensure that model files generated by XLang can seamlessly interoperate with existing systems and frameworks?
Cross-language support: XLang currently focuses on model files in formats such as XML, JSON, and YAML, while support for other programming languages (such as Python, Go, etc.) is relatively limited. How to extend XLang’s cross-language support so that it can better collaborate with other languages and frameworks is a direction that requires further research.

5. Maintainability and readability of Delta computation
Maintainability of Delta computation: When handling complex business logic, Delta computation may cause the model file structure to become very complex. How to ensure the maintainability of such complexity, especially in multi-person collaborative development scenarios, is an issue that needs consideration. For example, when Delta computation involves multiple levels of inheritance and overrides, how do we ensure the model file remains maintainable?
Readability of Delta computation: When handling complex business logic, Delta computation may reduce the readability of model files. How to ensure the readability of Delta computation, especially in multi-person collaborative development scenarios, is an issue that needs consideration. For example, when Delta computation involves multiple levels of inheritance and overrides, how do we ensure the model file remains readable?


Performance and scalability:

What is the complexity of the compile-time Delta merge algorithm? For large-scale DSL models (e.g., tens of thousands of nodes), are there performance bottlenecks?

How are dynamically generated XNodes optimized at runtime? Is JIT compilation or precompiled caching supported to reduce runtime overhead?

Syntax and toolchain:

Why choose XML rather than a more concise syntax such as S-expressions or modern markup languages (e.g., TOML) as the core syntax? Could XML extension attributes (such as x:override) introduce syntactic ambiguity?

How does XLang’s IDE plugin implement breakpoints and debugging? Does it support cross-DSL debugging (e.g., mixing XScript and Java code)?

Ecosystem and practice:

How does XLang address compatibility with traditional object-oriented programming paradigms? For example, can it directly invoke Java libraries or interact with Spring Beans?

Is there a plan to support WASM or GraalVM native images to expand its usage in cloud-native scenarios?

Boundaries of Delta computation:

Could Delta merging lead to “Delta conflicts”? How do we resolve competing modifications from multiple Deltas to the same node?

When dynamically loading Deltas at runtime, how do we ensure thread safety and state consistency? For example, during hot updates, requests may hit logic that mixes old and new versions.

Issues requiring further discussion
Merge algorithm complexity: Deeply nested merges in Tree structures may lead to increased algorithmic complexity. How can we ensure merge efficiency for large-scale models (e.g., over ten thousand nodes)? Should we introduce layered merging or incremental computation optimizations?

Adaptability to dynamic scenarios: Does compile-time Delta merging fail to cover runtime dynamics (such as configuration hot updates)? If support is needed, how do we balance flexibility and performance?

Conflict resolution mechanism: When multiple Deltas are stacked, how do we resolve attribute conflicts (such as multiple Deltas modifying the same node)? Is there a Git-like conflict marking and resolution process?

Toolchain maturity: Although an IDEA plugin is mentioned, concrete capabilities (such as debugging support and visual merge tools) are not demonstrated. The completeness of the toolchain directly affects developer experience and adoption.
